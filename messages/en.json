I focus on AI-driven testing and agentic approaches to eliminate routine work and shift quality left. I see QA as a partner to product and engineering, not a final gatekeeper — automation handles execution, QA focuses on risks and continuous improvement. I stay hands-on: Playwright, TypeScript, CI/CD, Azure.",
